# Simplecrawler with PhantomJS 

Extremely basic example which demonstrates how one might connect phantomjs to
simplecrawler to aid in link discovery.

This example utilises both phantom and simplecrawler's inbuilt discovery
function.

Basically, we are using infrastructure of "simplecrawler" to achieve our crawling goals:

- targeted links with patterns
- spiders control (on demand)
